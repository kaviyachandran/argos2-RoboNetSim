*** INTRODUCTION ***

In this package you'll find a controller that implements behaviour of relay, mission agents and base station with collision avoidance and navigation.

**** Map Actuator has the following ***
footbot_beacon => 0x27af278
footbot_leds => 0x27af318
footbot_wheels => 0x27abda8
wifi => 0x27aab78

*** Identifier code ***

Relay:
2 - Relay sending hello to mission agents
3 - Relay sending acceptance to receive data

Agents:
0 - Agent sending profile data to relay
1 - Agent sending data to relay after receiving acceptance 


*** choosing Mission Agent to collect data ***

Now relay responds to the mision agents based on the order it receives message from mission agents.

Should the relay respond to the agent which is farthest from it or based on the amount of data it has to transmit ? 

How does relay prioritize among agents?



*** COMPILATION ***


$ mkdir build
$ cd build

To produce debuggable code (slow), type:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

To produce fast but not debuggable code, type:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

Finally, launch the compilation with the command:

$ make

If you find no error, you're ready to go to the next phase.
