When there are more number of agents, goal positions can be distinguished by id. store in map with id -> key, struct-> valuev

To DO:

change randomwaypoint -> mission agent (size add it to xml)

In relay controller restrict the spiral motion to a certain time limit.-> Total time for a run / Number of agents assigned to a relay

Draw sequence diagram, state  transition diagram

Collect data and plot


time limit = 3*time taken to cover the diagonal

time for each agent = [time limit - time taken to cover the diagonal(this is done to consider the time to go back to base station)]/					   No of agent

 What if I make the relays only explore the environment. They will collect the data from agents when they meet on the way. I need to coordinate the relays so that they dont explore the same region as some other relay.


 Idea :

 Use Q-learning to learn a particular quadrant as important based on the number of agents it met in a quadrant

 Limitation:

 Disk model assumed is not accurate
